# HPC_Cvode

Implementation of stand-alone CVODE integrators for CPU and GPU implementations

This implementation of the integrator needs functions generated from an external library called PyJac. Pyjac containts information about the chemisty, this is intended to replace cantera for chemistry data. 

## Dependencies 

- CVode library from Sundials (6.2)

- PyJac library for right-hand function, dy/dt = f(t,y), and Analytical Jacobian matrix evaluation

## Directories

- "./app_serial/" Original code for integrators (currently not working)

- "./app_serial_enhanced/" Fixed bugs from original and additional functionality. It depends from "utils.hpp/cpp" for reading, writing, mesh structures, etc, and "cvode_user.hpp/cpp" to link CVode and PyJac libraries

## Build System

Compilation of executables and PyJac library is carried out by CMake.

### Instructions

    - mkdir build
    - cd build
    - cmake ..
    - make -j 4

### Setting CMake to build with atypical Sundials path

    - cmake -DSUNDIALS_EXTERN_ENABLE=ON -DSUNDIALS_EXTERN_LIBS=<path/sundials/lib/> -DSUNDIALS_EXTERN_INCLUDE_PATH=</path/sundials/include/> ..
